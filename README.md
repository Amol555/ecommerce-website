# ecommerce-website

Welcome to the First Capstone project. I had a great time in the Front-End Web Development I have created Shopping website which contains different pages like homepage All-product page login page etc. I tried to make the website beautiful by giving different effects and to make it responsive I used bootstrap and media-queries.
Index-page. I used background image to give a cover photo give brand name and Slogan. I have linked all the pages with Anchor tag. Index page contain header, Navbar, Footer. Some links are disabled but links like home contact us and login page are responsive. I tried so hard to make the Header Footer and navbar dynamic but the code was not showing any output so I wrote code of this pages.
Contacts Page: Same as Index page have used bootstrap to create navbar, header and footer. I used background image to give a cover photo give brand name and Slogan. I have linked all the pages with Anchor tag. I have used the form for create the register form. And one image beside.
Homepage: Same as Index page have used bootstrap to create navbar, header and footer. I used background image and Add the Featured Product. I have used Cards design to create the products images and gave Carousel Effects and some Hover effect to the Button.
Gave header Footer and links that though to different pages.

Login Page: I have used JavaScript to create the Login page and use form validation some CSS effects. To gave a decent look I have changed the opacity of background. Gave some alignment properties and also the flex to make it more responsive.
Cart page: I gave the link of this page to the navbar logo that through the link to Add Cart page.
This page contains summary and the table which is responsive like when we use pc or any other wide screen displays it shows on 12cols and when we use small devices it shows the 6clos only some dummy buttons like delete. I use the Font Awesome website to add the symbols.

All product page: Same as Home page I have used bootstrap to create navbar, header and footer. I used background image and Add the Featured Product. I have used Cards design to create the products images and gave Carousel Effects and some Hover effect to the Button.


Header, Footer & Navbar: In this project I have used the Dynamic Header, Footer & Navbar in which I have created the one file containing the Header components, one containing the Footer components and one containing the Navbar components and injected them dynamically using JQuery into the required element on every page.  To reduce the repetition of same code in every page.
